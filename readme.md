This is a website that helps in upon  managing.
For this project i have used HTML, Tailwind css, Typescript.
But browser only understands css and javascript.
So typescript is converted to javascript using 'tsc' command and tailwind is converted into regular css that is stored in output.css
I have made a navigation bar using unordered list containig other lists, added anchor tags so that one can visit to other pages like pricing, login, signup etc, also a search bar is added but not functional.
website takes input like names, subject, date, task and shows a button to submit.
After submiting all the tasks shows in output page below the form.
One can edit and delete the task.
one can change the pending or completed option.
All the datas are stored locally in the browser.
This website follows CRUD operations.
